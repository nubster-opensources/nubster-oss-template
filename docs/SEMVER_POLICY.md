# Semantic Versioning policy

{{project-name}} follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with explicit conventions for the 0.x phase.

## 0.x phase (pre-1.0)

While the major version is 0, breaking changes are allowed on a minor version bump:

- `0.1.x` -> `0.1.y` (patch): bug fixes, performance improvements, internal refactors, additive non-breaking changes. No public API change observable by a downstream user.
- `0.x.y` -> `0.X.0` (minor): may introduce breaking changes. Removed items must have been deprecated for at least one previous minor release whenever feasible.

Reasoning: every component of {{project-name}} is shipped early to gather feedback. Locking ourselves into strict Semver semantics before the API surface is stable would prevent the changes we know we still need.

## 1.0 and beyond

Once 1.0 is reached, {{project-name}} commits to strict Semver:

- Major (`X.0.0`): breaking changes to the public API.
- Minor (`1.Y.0`): backwards-compatible additions.
- Patch (`1.x.Z`): backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Public API definition

The public API consists of every item that is reachable from a crate's root through `pub` re-exports, except items marked `#[doc(hidden)]`. This includes:

- Public types, traits, functions, constants and modules.
- Trait method signatures and associated types.
- Public re-exports from sibling crates (when a facade crate re-exports curated items).

Items that are explicitly NOT part of the public API:

- Anything under a module annotated `#[doc(hidden)]`.
- Test-only helpers under `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Internal implementation details that do not affect observable behaviour.

TODO: extend this section with project-specific public surface definitions (e.g. on-disk schemas, wire formats, serialised types) as the project matures.

## Deprecation cycle

Before removing a public API item, it must go through at least one release where it is annotated `#[deprecated]` with a replacement hint. The replacement must exist in the same release as the deprecation.

## Breaking change documentation

Every breaking change is documented in `CHANGELOG.md` under a `### Changed` or `### Removed` sub-section, with migration instructions when the migration path is non-trivial.

## MSRV

The MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) is governed by [MSRV_POLICY.md](MSRV_POLICY.md). An MSRV bump is treated as a minor version bump.
